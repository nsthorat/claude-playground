# Claude Code Session Transcript

## Session: iOS Sensor Diagnostics Web App

---

### Initial Setup

**User:** hello

**Claude:** Hello! How can I help you today?

---

**User:** is bun installed

**Claude:** Yes, bun is installed. Version 1.3.4.

---

**User:** let's use bun to initialize a simple react project with a publish script that publishes to github pages on the pages branch

**Claude:** Created a React project with Vite using `bun create vite . --template react`, added `gh-pages` package, and configured a publish script.

---

### GitHub Pages Configuration

**User:** maybe we write index at the root, or somehow make the github pages point to "out"?

**Claude:** GitHub Pages can serve from either root `/` or `/docs` folder on a branch. The cleanest option is to build to `docs/` instead of `dist/`.

**User:** yes

**Claude:** Updated vite.config.js to output to `docs/`, removed gh-pages package, simplified publish script.

---

### Simplifying the App

**User:** say hi in the website make it simple, then publish then commit and push

**Claude:** Simplified App.tsx to just display "hi", built, committed, and pushed.

---

**User:** use typescript please

**Claude:** Converted project to TypeScript - renamed .jsx to .tsx, added tsconfig.json, updated index.html entry point.

---

### Branch Management

**User:** if i merge this PR could you continue on a new branch

**Claude:** Yes, after you merge the PR, just let me know and I'll fetch the latest main, create a new branch from it, and continue working.

**User:** ok it's merged

**Claude:** Fetched and checked out latest main.

---

### Sensor API Research

**User:** now i want you to do deep research online about all the sensor APIs available on web on iOS and write a report of the APIs

**Claude:** Performed extensive web research and compiled a comprehensive report:

#### Supported Sensor APIs on iOS Safari:
1. **DeviceMotion & DeviceOrientation Events** ✅ - Requires permission on iOS 13+
2. **Compass/Magnetometer** ✅ - Via `webkitCompassHeading` property
3. **Geolocation API** ✅ - Fully supported
4. **Camera & Microphone (getUserMedia)** ✅ - Via WebRTC
5. **Touch Force (3D Touch)** ✅ - On compatible devices

#### Unsupported APIs (Apple declined due to privacy):
- Generic Sensor API ❌
- Vibration API ❌
- Web Bluetooth ❌
- Web NFC ❌
- Ambient Light Sensor ❌
- Proximity Sensor ❌
- Barometer ❌
- Battery Status API ❌
- Network Information API ❌
- Device Memory API ❌

### Building the Diagnostic Page

**User:** okay now make this website into a beautiful diagnostic page with all of these APIs available. Please google claude skills for UI design and follow those.

**Claude:** Researched Claude UI design skills and built a beautiful diagnostic page following the principles:

#### Design Principles Applied:
- **Typography:** Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono fonts (distinctive, not generic)
- **Color:** Dark theme with cyan/purple gradient accents (cohesive aesthetic)
- **Motion:** Staggered fade-in animations on page load
- **Backgrounds:** Layered CSS gradients for atmosphere

#### Features Implemented:
- Live sensor data display for motion, orientation, geolocation
- iOS permission request buttons
- Status badges (granted/denied/prompt/unavailable)
- Touch force detection with real-time feedback
- Unsupported API indicators with explanations
- Mobile-first responsive design
